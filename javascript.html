	<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
		<p>JaveScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is ectremely popular fo ra variety of reasons. It is small and lightweight language allowing maximum gliexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of differnt directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web brower or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
		<ul>
				<li><span style="color:#4baeb9; text-decoration:underline;">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variable must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;</li>
				<li><span style="color:#4baeb9; text-decoration: underline;">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables- our cup can now have coffee poured init, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li>
				<li><span style="color:#4baeb9; text-decoration: underline;">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be avle to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number -42 or 3.14159; String- "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array- [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object- {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</li>
				<li><span style="color:#4baeb9; text-decoration: underline;">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in you code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is flase; else we execute this block of code;</li>
				<li><span style="color:#4baeb9; text-decoration: underline;">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
				<li><span style="color:#4baeb9; text-decoration: underline;">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again</li>
